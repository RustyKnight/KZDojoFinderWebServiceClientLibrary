#KZDojoFinderWebServiceClientLibrary

This is the client facing library for the Dojo Finder Web Service.This library was designed and tested against the [KZDojoFinderPerfectWebService](https://github.com/RustyKnight/KZDojoFinderPerfectWebService) but by its very nature, isn't tied to itThis API is intended to facility the communications with the web service, it's not focused on the fulfilling the requirements of the [KZDojoFinderLibrary](https://github.com/RustyKnight/KZDojoFinderLibrary).  

The intention is that this library will form the backbone for other libraries which need to communicate with the web service, so they can focus on fulfilling the requirements of that API and not generating more code to simply talk with the web service itself
